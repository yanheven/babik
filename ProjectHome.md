This is a lightweight mpd client built on top of the django web framework with the goal of allowing quick and easy access to all the music in your collection, accessible controls from anywhere, and ease of installation.

The entire package is wrapped up into a single django app. No database is required, and installation consists of simply adding babik to your installed directories and linking the media to a location that your webserver has access to.
