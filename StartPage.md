# Introduction #

## No longer being maintained ##

Babik was a project I wrote and maintained for use in an office I worked in. It hasn't been properly cared for since that time and is likely completely unusable at this point.

## Description ##

Babik seaks to be a lightweight easy to use and install mpd client.  Built on [django](http://djangoproject.com) and using [py-libmpdclient](http://incise.org/index.cgi/py-libmpdclient2) as a code base.
