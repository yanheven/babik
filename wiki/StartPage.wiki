Babik was a project I wrote and maintained for use in an office I worked in. It hasn't been properly cared for since that time and is likely completely unusable at this point.

== Description ==

Babik seaks to be a lightweight easy to use and install mpd client.  Built on [http://djangoproject.com django] and using [http://incise.org/index.cgi/py-libmpdclient2 py-libmpdclient] as a code base.
